# 🔁 Customer Churn Prediction

A complete end-to-end machine learning project to predict customer churn using the Telco dataset. This notebook includes data cleaning, EDA, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of important features.

## 📊 Project Features

- Logistic Regression model for binary churn classification
- Scaled data with `StandardScaler`
- Feature encoding using `pd.get_dummies`
- Confusion matrix and classification report for evaluation
- Horizontal bar chart of top churn-driving features

## 📁 Files Included

- `customer_churn_prediction.ipynb`
- (Optional) `churn_feature_plot.png`

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Customers with **Fiber Optic Internet**, **Streaming Services**, and **Paperless Billing** were more likely to churn.
- The model achieved a strong baseline for churn classification using Logistic Regression.

## 👩‍💻 Built With

- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
